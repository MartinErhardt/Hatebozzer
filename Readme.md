Hatebozzer
======

Hatebozzer is my attempt to a little scriptable(in fact it uses its own script language!) IRC Bot in Python with multithreading and tor encryption

How to
======

type
python3 ./hatebozzer.py
or:
python ./hatebozzer.py

Hatebozzer is supporting both versions

Now scripts/hello_world.ht is executed.
And you can interact over the shell.

type /help() for a full list of builtin functions
